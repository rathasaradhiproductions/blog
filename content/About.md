"Hi This is **Keerthisai**! I’m a Shortfilm Maker.Also I’m a Youtuber **"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjbxZzNgHTY"** **Please check out my channel**. 
As a short film maker, I have always been fascinated with the art of storytelling through the medium of film. I believe that cinema has the power to inspire, educate, and entertain people, and it is my passion to create films that do just that.

Apart from being a short film maker, I am also an avid astrologer. The mysteries of the universe have always intrigued me, and I find great delight in studying the movements of celestial bodies and their impact on our lives. I believe that astrology is a fascinating tool that can help us gain insights into our personalities and destinies.

In addition to these interests, I also love making videos, cooking, and listening to music. I enjoy experimenting with different recipes and trying out new things in the kitchen, and I find that music is the perfect accompaniment to the cooking process. Making videos, whether it's editing or creating content for my short films, is also something that I find immensely satisfying.

Overall, I am a curious and creative person who loves to explore new avenues of expression. Whether it's through film, astrology, or any other creative pursuit, I always try to approach things with a fresh perspective and an open mind. If you share any of these interests, I would love to connect with you and maybe even collaborate on a project or two!
